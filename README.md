Data Mining Final Project



Abstract:
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related deaths world-wide. Small cell lung cancer
(SCLC), the most common type of lung cancer, have both reacted well to chemo-, radiation-, and
adjuvant treatments. Surgery to remove the tumor also appeared to be a viable treatment option.
However, these treatments had unfavorable side effects, necessitating the development of alternate
lung cancer medications such as novel drugs. Activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) protein is a key reason for lung cancer.
Our project aims to compare various regression algorithms such as Random Forest Regressor,
Ada-boost Regressor and Bagging Regressor to predict the efficacy of a drug in inhibiting the
growth of cancer cells.



Methodology:
The methodology for this project was divided into four parts: -
2.1. Data Collection
2.2. Exploratory Data Analysis
2.3. Molecular Fingerprint Calculation
2.4. Feature Engineering and Model Building
